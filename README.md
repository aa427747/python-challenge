# Python-Challenge

There are 2 parts to this challenge.  Both challenges use core python to create counts and functions and print them out for the user to view.

From the instructions README:  Both of these challenges encompasses a real-world situation where your newfound Python scripting skills can come in handy. These challenges are far from easy so expect some hard work ahead!
